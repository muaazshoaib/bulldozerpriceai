# BulldozerPriceAI: Bulldozer Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
BulldozerPriceAI is a regression model designed to predict bulldozer prices using historical auction data. The model uses popular machine learning techniques like Linear Regression and Random Forest to forecast prices based on features such as machine age, condition, and other attributes.

## Key Technologies:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy

## Approach:
- Data preprocessing: handling missing data, scaling features
- Model development: Linear Regression, Random Forest
- Model evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared

## Outcome:
- Delivered a high-performing price prediction model for bulldozers
- Gained experience in regression models and feature engineering
